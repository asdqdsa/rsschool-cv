### About

![Profile picture](./pfp.jpeg)

Having worked in a software company as a QA engineer has taught me how much I actually don't know about software engineering and how much I liked working with a group of people, building something from scratch, contributing to a common cause.

My current goal is to walk the path of a student that wants to become a web developer, so that I could apply my skills and, if lucky, get intership.

I consider myself an open-minded individual that devotes his life to what he trully enjoys. Always intrested in new things. As hobby I recently have picked up Chinese as a third language, and I also have a soft spot for picoCTF.
